# Classic-Cryptography
Something tiny but historical~Classic Cryptography!
Here are some tools, representing achievements of classic cryptography.
These codes include cryptor and decryptor,but not cracker!
Many crackers need the help of human, like judging "if this letter 'E'?" or "How long the cipher key may be?"
So there is no cracke code,but I'd like to share some methods to crack certain crypto method.
Thanks!
